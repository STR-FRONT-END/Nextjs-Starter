This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

Next.js has a few tricks up its sleeve to help us navigate between pages.

## Link component
Similar to an `<a>` tag, we can use the `Link` component from then `next/link` module. 

```jsx
<Link href="/settings">
  <a>settings</a>
</Link>
```

There Link component allows you to do **client-side** routing. This is important because if you don't want that or are linking to another site, then you should just use an `a` tag instead.

You must have an `a` tag as the child of the `Link` component, but the `href` lives on the `Link`. 
> üëçüèæ&nbsp;&nbsp;**tip**: Update your linter to not error out because your `<a>` tag does not have an href.

The `href` prop takes a page name as it is in the pages directory.
For dynamic routes, you will need the `as` prop as well.

```jsx
<Link href="/user/[id].js" as={`/user/${user.id}`}>
  <a>user</a>
</Link>
```

Let's link our pages together!

```jsx
// pages/index.jsx
import React from 'react'
import Link from 'next/link'

export default () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Index page</h1>

    <Link href="/notes">
      <a>Notes</a>
    </Link>
  </div> 
)
```

```jsx
// pages/notes/index.jsx
import React from 'react'
import Link from 'next/link'

export default () => {
  const notes = new Array(15).fill(1).map((e, i) => ({id: i, title: `Note: ${i}`}))

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Notes</h1>

      {notes.map(note => (
        <div>
          <Link key={note.id} href="/notes/[id]" as={`/notes/${note.id}`}>
            <a>
              <strong>{note.title}</strong>
            </a>
          </Link>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx
// pages/notes/[id].jsx
import React from 'react'
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'
import Link from 'next/link'

export default () => {
  const router = useRouter()
  const { id }= router.query

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Note: {id} </h1>

      <Link href="/notes">
        <a>Notes</a>
      </Link>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Programmatic routing

For when you need to route between pages programmatically, you can use the router to do so. There are [many methods](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction) on the router that you can use, so we'll focus on the ones we'll use in this course.


Just like the `Link` component, use the router for client-side routing. To navigate to a page, you can use the `push` method, which works like `href` on the `Link` component.

```jsx 
import React from 'react'
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

export default () => {
  const router = useRouter()
  const id = 2

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={e => router.push('/')}>
        Go Home
      </button>

      <button onClick={e => router.push('/user/[id]', `/user/${id}`)}>
        Dashboard
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

And that's all there is to routing!
Our app doesn't look much like an app, no worries, we're going to fix that next.
